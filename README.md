## Introduction

TeeGears is an electronics company managing multiple product categories across regional stores. The company records all inventory transactions including sales, restocks, and returns. 

However, inconsistent restock patterns, increasing return rates, and unclear customer segmentation have raised concerns about inventory efficiency and sales performance.

Management needs to make data-driven decisions to reduce overstocking and stockouts, identify high-performing and underperforming products, understand regional sales differences, track the impact of discounts and returns, monitor customer type behavior (Retail vs Wholesales).

This project focuses on building an interactive Excel dashboard to track and monitor product movement within an inventory system. The dashboard provides real-time insights into revenue, restocks, returns, and customer behavior across different product lines, suppliers, and regions.

## Key Metrics

•	Which products are driving the highest revenue?

•	Are certain regions performing better than others?

•	What is the impact of discounting on sales volume?

•	Which products have high return rates, and why?

•	Are restock quantities aligned with sales demand?

•	Who is our top revenue generating supplier?

## Skills Demonstrated

•	Excel functions

•	Pivot table 

•	Pivot chart

## Data Cleaning 

Before building the dashboard, the dataset underwent the following data preparation steps:

•	Removed duplicates and irrelevant rows

•	Standardized date formats to ensure monthly trend analysis

•	Handled missing values in quantity and revenue fields

## Visualization

## Key Insights

•	Top Revenue-Generating Products include Monitor 24 inch,  Wireless Mouse, and Camera Zoom

•	The West region appears to be among the most active in terms of transactions.

•	Retail customers contributed slightly more revenue than wholesalers, indicating strong B2C sales performance.

•	Wireless Mouse, Bluetooth speaker, and smartwatch Y has a high return rate, signaling possible product quality issues.

•	Restocks closely follow top-selling items, confirming alignment between demand and supply.

•	NovaDistributor recorded the highest total revenue among all suppliers, indicating  strong sales performance across its product line.

•	However, it also has a high return rate, suggesting potential quality issues or mismatch in  customer expectations.

## Recommendations

•	Investigate high return rate products (like Wireless Mouse,  Bluetooth speaker, and smartwatch Y) to identify quality or delivery issues.

•	Increase inventory for high-performing products  to meet demand.

•	Use regional insights to plan location-specific marketing strategies.

•	Continue monitoring trends monthly to detect early shifts in customer demand.

•	NovaDistributor is the top revenue-generating supplier but has a high return rate — this dual performance demands closer supplier evaluation
